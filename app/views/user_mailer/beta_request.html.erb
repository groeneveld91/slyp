    <p>Hey, James here. I'm the founder of Slyp.
    <p>thanks so much for joining our beta :) slyp is about organizing the internet by relevancy to you and your friends. newsfeeds are full of content that may never be relevant to you. often times they are full of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickbait">"clickbait"</a> who's only purpose is for monetizing your eye-balls. we are focusing on changing the use of the share button from posting on social media newsfeeds, to sharing directly with your friends on slyp.</p>
    <p>We will be in touch with an invitation email shortly. In the meantime please feel free to reply to me here with thoughts, questions or general musings. I always reply :) </p>
    <p>cheers,<br /> james & the <%= link_to "slyp.io", controller: "home", action: "index", email: @beta_request.email %> team :)</p>
