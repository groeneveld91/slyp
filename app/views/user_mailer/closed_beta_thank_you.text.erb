Hey <%= @user.first_name %>!

Thank you for trialling Slyp. Feedback from everyone was exciting. We'll be back in July. In the meantime we have 3 questions -- http://goo.gl/forms/RS8tkzcFD1V3DKk52.

We imagine a future of less time wasted with clickbait media -- http://www.wired.com/2015/12/psychology-of-clickbait/ -- and more time engaging our smartest friends on the web's best content.

As promised we have deleted all of your data from our end. Here is the list links you had in your account before we deleted it:
<% @user.slyps.each do |slyp| %>
  <%= link_to slyp.title, slyp.url %>
<% end %>

With much love,
Slyp

PS: I'll always reply to your replies, so hit me up!
