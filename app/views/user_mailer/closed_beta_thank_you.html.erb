    <p>Hey <%= @user.first_name %>!</p>
    <p>Thank you for trialling Slyp. Feedback from everyone was exciting. We'll be back in July. In the meantime we have 3 questions -- <%= link_to "http://goo.gl/forms/RS8tkzcFD1V3DKk52", "http://goo.gl/forms/RS8tkzcFD1V3DKk52" %>.</p>
    <p>We imagine a future of less time wasted with <%= link_to "clickbait media", "http://www.wired.com/2015/12/psychology-of-clickbait/" %> and more time engaging our smartest friends on the web's best content.</p>
    <p>As promised we have deleted all of your data from our end. Here is the list links you had in your account before we deleted it:<br/>
      <% @user.slyps.each do |slyp| %>
        <%= link_to slyp.title, slyp.url %><br/>
      <% end %>
    </p>
    <p>With much love,<br/>Slyp</p>
    <p>PS: I'll always reply to your replies, so hit me up!</p>
